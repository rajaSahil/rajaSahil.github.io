# Understanding Computer Memory: An Overview of How Computers Remember

In this blog, we'll explore the fundamentals of computer memory and the complexities involved in storing and managing data.

## Introduction
> In an operating system (OS), **Memory** refers to several types of storage used to temporarily or permanently store data.

### Types of memory
1. Registers
2. Cache
3. RAM(Random Access Memory)
4. Virtual Memory
5. Swap space
6. Persistent storage

## Registers

- **Registers** are small, fast storage locations that's present within CPU which is used to hold data 
that is being processed. 
- They are the fastest type of memory and directly accessible by the CPU, generally used for the processing.

### Usage

- Used to hold instructions, addresses and immediate data needed for processing.
  - Consider a few critical documents or notes that you keep right on the desk. These are the things 
  that you might need immediately and can access in a split second

## Cache Memory

- **Cache memory** is extremely fast, small storage used to reduce latency in accessing data.
- It stores data and instructions, that's frequently accessed to speed up the processing. **It is faster than
  CPU and located closer to the CPU.**

### Usage 

- CPU cache (L1, L2 and L3) hold copies of frequently used data from main memory to speed up processing.
  - Consider you have a planner where you notes down all the important tasks and reminders you will need soon.
    It's quick to go through the planner compared to entire cabinet.

## RAM(Random Access Memory)

- **RAM** is used for storing data and instructions that CPU needs to access quickly. 
- It is fast, temporary storage used for currently running processes and active data.
- It is volatile i.e data is lost when power is turned off.

### Usage

- These are generally used for running applications, opening files, and operating system's core
  functions are loaded into the RAM to speed up processing.
  - For documents and resources you uses throughout the day, you would like to store it in the cabinet.
    It would take a bit more time to grab from cabinet than from the **desk(Registers) or planner(Cache)**.

## Virtual Memory

- **Virtual Memory** uses disk space used to extend RAM capacity. 
- It allows OS to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from RAM to disk storage. 
This process is called **Paging**.
- It is slower than RAM but helps to extends the available memory space.

### Usage

- When system runs out of RAM, it uses a portion of the **Hard drive or SSD** as an extension of RAM.
  - When the cabinet gets full, an additional remote storage room is used. Although, it's slower to access,
    but it's helpful when cabinet is full.

## Swap Space

- **Swap Space** is disk space used to swap out RAM contents temporarily.It is a dedicated area of disk
  storage used for virtual memory.
- It holds inactive pages of memory that are moved out of RAM to free up space for active processes.
- It is slower than RAM.

### Usage 

- It helps manage memory usage and prevents system crashes due to insufficient RAM.
  - The remote storage room has a special section called backup storage. If you don't need some resources
    frequently, you generally store them here. It takes longer to retrieve these resources to those in the cabinet.

## Persistent storage

- **Persistent storage** refers to non-volatile storage used to store data permanently. It includes **HDDs**, **SSDs** and other forms
  forms of storage.
- It is slower than RAM, but data can be retained even if power is turned off.

### Usage

- It is generally used to store operating system, application, files and long term data. 
  - For long-term resources, you might use off-site storage room. This is like a data warehouse, where you keep everything that might be needed someday but not for daily work.
